Player-Piano
============

Stochastic midi player piano code for Arduino, using Markov chains to create random performances

Random-Player-1 = first prototype, working code. Includes a quantizer to lock random notes to certain scales, and a random but weighted rhythm generator 

Player-Piano = main project, with markov chain for note selection 

Markov-3D = back to basics, really understand markov chains. Realise that 2kb of arduino memory isn't enough to do a 3rd order markov chain on 7 notes. Order Arduino Mega on ebay.
