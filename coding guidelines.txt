Coding guidelines 

1. Never hard code real numbers - always use variables 
2. Only abstract code if it helps what you're doing now, not for the sake of it 
3. Give functions a clear purpose, i.e. draw_table better than do_analysis
4. Turn long unwieldy scripts into short purposeful functions. 
5. Make functions shy: inputs and outputs should be clear. 
6. No line longer than 100 chars 
7. Good variable names reduce need for comments 
8. Use complete words, not abbreviations, for variable names
9. Indent loops and functions by 4 spaces 
10. Pad equals, commas, arithmetic with a space 
11. Do complicated equations a step at a time to make them easier to read 
12. Make variable names consistent 
    UppercaseUppercase for library names 
    lowercaseUppercase for functions
    lowercase_uppercase for variables 
    LOWERCASE_UPPERCASE for global variables  
    Use Nouns for variables
    Use Verbs for functions 

13. Check for errors in the code to make it robust
